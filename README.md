# Installing CADViewer NodeJS Conversion Server

The CADViewer NodeJS Conversion server (nodejs/cadviewer-conversion-server/) is used in six different implementations: **NodeJS**, **Angular**,**ReactJS**, **Laravel**, **Rails7** and **VueJS**. 

The repository contains a full setup including converters and NodeJS controlling script


## This package contains

1: NodeJS script library for controlling CAD Conversions and communication with CADViewer  - in its preferred folder structure

2: AutoXchange AX2023 Converter and DWG Merge 2023 Converter - in their preferred folder structure

***Note:*** If on Linux, unpack the compressed AX2023 binary in /converters/ax2023/linux and update the executable name in CADViewer_config.json.

3: All structures for file-conversion, sample drawings, redlines, etc. 


## This package does not contain

4: The converter folder structure contains a larger set of fonts, installed in /cadviewer/converters/ax2023/windows/fonts/, but a fuller set of fonts can be installed. 

Read the sections on installing and handling [Fonts](https://tailormade.com/ax2020techdocs/installation/fonts/) in [AutoXchange 2023 TechDocs](https://tailormade.com/ax2020techdocs/) and [TroubleShooting](https://tailormade.com/ax2020techdocs/troubleshooting/).



## How to Use

1: Depending on the implementation, copy: CADViewer_config_XXXXXX.json -> ***CADViewer_config.json*** (where XXXXXX is either NodeJS, Angular, Laravel, ReactJS, Rails7 or VueJS), to set up a template server and path configuration prior to running the server. 

2: Ensure that all paths and ports are set correctly in ***CADViewer_config.json***, we use port 3000 as standard, but the given setup or framework may require a different setting. 

3: The ***CADViewer_config.json*** is set up for a Windows server.  If runnung on Linux do the following: 

    3A:  Unpack the ax2023_L64_xx_yy_zz.tar.xz AutoXchange executable in /converters/ax2023/linux.  
    3B:  Move all unpacked files to /converters/ax2023/linux.
    3C:  In CADViewer_config.json update all paths so  /ax2023/windows is exchanged with /ax2023/linux
    3D:  Rename the ax2023_executable parameters, for example for version 23.05.87 it is "ax2023_executable" : "AX2023_W64_23_05_87.exe" on Windows, but "ax2023_executable" : "ax2023_L64_23_05_87"  for Linux.
    3F:  Ensure that the executable is chmod 777 permission and that the /converters/files folder has full read and write permission. 


3: The CAD converter [AutoXchange 2023](https://cadviewer.com/alldownloads/autoxchange), - and other converters -, needs to be installed and referenced through the configuration file. The converters typically is in the /nodejs/cadviewer-conversion-server/ folder structure, and the NodeJS download contains template folders in which to place the executables. 

4: This install includes the AutoXchange 2023 converter, but if needed, it can be updated from our [download](https://cadviewer.com/download) resources.

5: The [CADViewer](https://cadviewer.com/cadviewertechdocs) front-end can be found from our [download](https://cadviewer.com/download) resources, or installed directly from npm with: **npm i cadviewer**.

6: See [Business Extensions to Handlers](https://cadviewer.com/cadviewertechdocs/handlers_business/) and [CADViewer RESTFUL API](https://cadviewer.com/cadviewertechdocs/rest_api/) to extend the back-end with a customExtension for reading of Blobs/internal datastructure, etc. 



**NOTE:** Make sure the converter version number in CADViwer_config.json match the converters you install, and change any paths settings to correspond to your install folders.  

**Run:** the NodeJS server with:  *node CV_7.x.yy*
